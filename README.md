Discord bot built using https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html

Hopefully works under most normal circumstances...

Clone the repo then active the virtual environvent for you shell of choice and execute bot.py to start it. A settings.json file will need to be created with various API tokens for bot features to work correctly (see sample.json).
